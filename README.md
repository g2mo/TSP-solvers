# TSP Genetic Algorithm - Version 4

Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by comparing a Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) with a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm - Ant Colony Optimization (HGA-ACO).

## New Features in V4
- **Hybrid GA-ACO Algorithm**: Combines genetic operators with ant colony optimization
- **Pheromone-based guidance**: ACO pheromone trails guide solution construction
- **Algorithm comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of SGA vs HGA-ACO
- **Dual algorithm visualization**: Separate route plots for each algorithm
- **Performance metrics**: Detailed comparison of solution quality and execution time

## Features
- Two algorithm implementations:
  - **SGA**: Standard Genetic Algorithm with elitism
  - **HGA-ACO**: Hybrid approach combining GA and ACO strategies
- Real-time visualization of both algorithms
- Comprehensive performance comparison
- Configurable parameters for both algorithms
- Reproducible results with seeded random generation

Usage: `python main.py`
