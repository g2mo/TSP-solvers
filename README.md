# TSP Genetic Algorithm - Version 5

Advanced visualization for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) comparing Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) with Hybrid Genetic Algorithm - Ant Colony Optimization (HGA-ACO).

## New Features in V5
- **Enhanced 2x2 subplot layout**: Dedicated visualization space for each component
- **Separate route plots**: Individual route evolution for SGA and HGA-ACO
- **Pheromone heatmap**: Visual representation of ACO pheromone matrix
- **Improved layout**: Better organization and visual clarity
- **Execution time display**: Performance metrics in convergence plot
- **Optimized parameters**: Faster execution with smaller default values

## Features
- Two algorithm implementations:
  - **SGA**: Standard Genetic Algorithm with elitism
  - **HGA-ACO**: Hybrid approach with pheromone visualization
- Real-time visualization with four synchronized plots
- Comprehensive performance comparison
- Pheromone matrix evolution tracking

Usage: `python main.py`
