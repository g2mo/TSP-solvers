# TSP Genetic Algorithm - Version 3

A simple implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with real-time visualization.

## New Features in V3
- **Live plotting**: Real-time visualization of route evolution
- **Dual plot display**: 
  - Best route visualization with cities and paths
  - Fitness convergence graph showing cost improvement
- **Configurable update frequency**: Control plotting performance
- **Final route display**: Clear visualization of the best solution
- **Interactive matplotlib interface**: Pan, zoom, and examine results

## Features
- Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) with elitism
- Random city generation in configurable grid
- Tournament selection
- Ordered crossover operator
- Swap mutation operator
- Real-time visualization of algorithm progress
- Execution time measurement

Usage: `python main.py`
