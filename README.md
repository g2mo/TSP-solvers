# TSP Genetic Algorithm - Version 2

A simple implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## New Features in V2
- **Random city generation**: Configurable number of cities with seed for reproducibility
- **NumPy integration**: Efficient array operations for cities and distance matrix
- **Elitism**: Best individuals preserved across generations
- **Execution timing**: Performance measurement
- **Improved progress reporting**: Updates every 10 generations
- **Scalable parameters**: Automatic adjustment based on problem size

## Features
- Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) with elitism
- Random city generation in configurable grid
- Tournament selection
- Ordered crossover operator
- Swap mutation operator
- Console output with progress tracking
- Execution time measurement

## Usage
Usage: `python main.py`
